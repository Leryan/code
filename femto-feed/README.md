# Femto Feed

A feed reader so tiny it wont do much things.

## Usage

Clone this repo then:

Create a feed list `feeds.txt`:

```
https://first/url.rss
https://and/so/on.atom
```

```
cargo install femto-feed
femto-feed
$your_browser femtofeed.html
```

## TODO

 * [ ] Store old feed entries, cleanup by date
