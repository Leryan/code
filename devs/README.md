# Brain torture with languages.

List of language I test or use, and the "projects" created for. I will also add:

 * Links to documentation I read.
 * Links to topics I created if needed any help to proceed.
 * Feeling about the language.

# Learning

## Go

 * https://github.com/Leryan/spacegoal

### Documentation

 * https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html
 * https://golang.org/pkg/
 * https://gobyexample.com/

### Feeling

 * Really simple. Got a working little app in two days while learning the language.
 * Error management isn't very nice to me. Too simple, it's easy to forget a test.

### TODO

 * Channels
